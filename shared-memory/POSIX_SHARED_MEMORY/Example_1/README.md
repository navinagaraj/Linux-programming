Exercises of Linux kernel programming.


* PURPOSE
              * Using POSIX and we make it to shared memory and sending data from using MMAP(Memory map). process p1 (sender)  data to
                process p2 (reciver).  


* EXPLAINATION:

             * In this program we using process1.c and process2.c in the process1.c we write a data in the process1.c using MMAP (memory map).
               memory map is used to modifying the file .Each and every time we con't' do.By using mmap is reduce time.
               We recived data in process2.c then we need to print the same data what we enterd in process1.c.same data in process2.c.
