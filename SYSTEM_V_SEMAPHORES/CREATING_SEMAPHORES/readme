/* Description  : creating semaphores         */
/**********************************************/

The  semget()  system  call returns the System V semaphore set identifier
associated with the argument key.  A new set of nsems semaphores is  cre‐
ated  if key has the value IPC_PRIVATE or if no existing semaphore set is
associated with key and IPC_CREAT is specified in semflg.

semctl()  performs the control operation specified by cmd on the System V
semaphore set identified by semid, or on the semnum-th semaphore of  that
set.  (The semaphores in a set are numbered starting at 0.)

semop() performs operations on selected semaphores in the  set  indicated
by  semid.  Each of the nsops elements in the array pointed to by sops is
a structure that specifies an operation to be performed on a single sema‐
phore. 

In this programming we are using three process. process1 and process2 then 
write_process. First we going to run thr process1 the we running writeprocess
then finally we running a process2. In the my_data.txt having some text, That
same text has printed by process1 then the write_process is write in the 
my_data.txt file after that process2 will print the updated data in my_data.txt
file.
